Interactive Dashboard: A Cross-Platform Prototype for the Department of Engineering and Computer Science (ENCS) and LNG Center

1. Project Overview

This is a "Smart TV Dashboard Application Prototype" developed for the McNeese State University Department of Engineering & Computer Science. The application is designed to display important information, announcements, events, and university data in an engaging and user-friendly interface optimized for large display smart screen. However, the prototype will be displayed in an android tablet.
